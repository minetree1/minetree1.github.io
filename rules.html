          <li class="rule">No Cheating or Hacking
Any form of cheating, including the use of hacks, mods, or third-party programs to gain an unfair advantage, is strictly prohibited. This includes x-ray, auto-clickers, speed hacks, or any other unfair modifications.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Griefing
Griefing, or intentionally destroying someone else’s builds or property, is not allowed. This includes breaking blocks, stealing items, or destroying structures that are not part of PvP or agreed-upon battles.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Exploiting Bugs
If you find a bug or exploit in the game or server mechanics, do not take advantage of it. Report it immediately to an admin so it can be fixed. Exploiting bugs will result in penalties.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Harassment or Toxicity
Treat all players with respect. Harassment, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any form of toxic behavior will not be tolerated. Keep the server a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Spamming
Spamming the chat with excessive messages, commands, or advertising other servers is not allowed. Please keep chat respectful and organized. You can use /mute if you're bothered by spamming players.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Abusive Language
While we encourage friendly competition, foul language, insults, or offensive remarks are not acceptable. Keep the community clean and fun for everyone!</li>
          <li class="rule">Respect PvP Rules
While PvP is a core part of our Lifesteal server, be respectful of other players. No spawn camping (killing players immediately after they respawn), and do not engage in unfair fights (such as ganging up on a solo player without warning).</li>
          <li class="rule">No Advertising
Advertising other servers or external websites is not allowed. This includes posting IP addresses, server names, or links to external websites in chat or signs.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="discord-rules rules">
        <h2 class="discord-rules-title rules-title">Discord server</h2>
        <ol class="rules-list">
          <li class="rule">Be Respectful to Everyone
Treat all members with respect, kindness, and maturity. Personal attacks, harassment, discrimination, or hate speech will not be tolerated. We want to maintain a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for everyone.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Spamming
Avoid spamming the chat with excessive messages, emojis, or commands. If you're caught spamming, you'll receive a warning. Continuous spamming will lead to a mute or ban.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Toxicity or Flaming
Be mindful of your tone. We understand competitive gaming can get intense, but personal insults, name-calling, or inflammatory behavior will not be tolerated. Keep it friendly, even in heated discussions.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Advertising
Advertising other Discord servers, websites, or external links without permission is prohibited. Please refrain from posting unsolicited ads in any channel.</li>
          <li class="rule">Use Channels Appropriately
Each channel is designated for a specific purpose. Please ensure you're posting in the correct channels. For example, game-related content goes in the #game-chat, and general discussion goes in #general.</li>
          <li class="rule">No NSFW or Inappropriate Content
Do not post or share any inappropriate, explicit, or NSFW content. This includes images, videos, or links that are offensive or unsuitable for a general audience. Violations will lead to an immediate ban.</li>
          <li class="rule">Respect Staff and Their Decisions
The server staff are here to maintain a positive environment. Please respect their decisions and instructions. Arguing with staff may result in disciplinary actions.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Hate Speech or Discrimination
Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any form of discriminatory language or behavior will result in a ban. We are an inclusive community, and we expect everyone to respect each other.</li>

        <ol class="rules-list">
          <li class="rule">No Auto-Farming or AFK Farming
Using any methods that result in AFK (away-from-keyboard) farming or automation of resources is not allowed. This includes using bots, macros, or other automated systems that collect resources for you.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Teaming in Solo PvP Zones
If you're in a designated solo PvP zone or event, do not team up with others. Fight fair and solo, as the game intended. Teaming in these areas will lead to penalties.</li>
          <li class="rule">Follow the Staff's Instructions
Always follow the instructions of the admins and moderators. They are here to help and ensure everyone has a fun and fair experience. Arguing with staff may result in a ban.</li>
          <li class="rule">Respect Server Events and Competitions
When participating in events or competitions, follow the specific rules set for each. Cheating during events or disrupting the competitions will result in disqualification and possible bans.</li>
          <li class="rule">Keep Builds Appropriate
Keep all builds family-friendly. Do not create offensive, inappropriate, or disturbing builds. If a build is deemed inappropriate, it will be removed, and the player may face a ban.</li>
          <li class="rule">No Trolling or Purposefully Disrupting Gameplay
Trolling, such as intentionally ruining other players’ experiences for fun, is not allowed. This includes killing players without reason, blocking paths, or being disruptive in-game.</li>
